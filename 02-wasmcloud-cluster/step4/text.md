### Deploying our first app


#### Start the actor

Lets deploy a simple service.

`wash start actor wasmcloud.azurecr.io/dogs-and-cats:0.2.4`{{exec}}

We will be able to see our deployed actor if we check the inventory of our node:

`wash get inventory $(wash get hosts -ojson | jq -r '.hosts[0].id')`{{exec}}

Of course you will also see the deployed actor in the UI on [localhost:4000]({{TRAFFIC_HOST1_4000}}).

Now the actor alone can't do anything, as it first needs a couple of capabilities in order to be called via HTTP:

#### Deploy the capability providers

1. `wash start provider wasmcloud.azurecr.io/httpserver:0.17.0`{{exec}}
2. `wash start provider wasmcloud.azurecr.io/httpclient:0.7.0`{{exec}}

> Note that this might take a little while, as the providers are downloaded from the internet.

Now that we have deployed the capability providers, we now need to link them to our actor

#### Link Actor and Providers

1. `wash link put MCUCZ7KMLQBRRWAREIBQKTJ64MMQ5YKEGTCRGPPV47N4R72W2SU3EYMU VAG3QITQQ2ODAOWB5TTQSDJ53XK3SHBEIFNK4AYJ5RKAX2UNSCAPHA5M wasmcloud:httpserver ADDRESS=0.0.0.0:8080`{{exec}}
2. `wash link put MCUCZ7KMLQBRRWAREIBQKTJ64MMQ5YKEGTCRGPPV47N4R72W2SU3EYMU VCCVLH4XWGI3SGARFNYKYT2A32SUYA2KVAIV2U2Q34DQA7WWJPFRKIKM wasmcloud:httpclient`{{exec}}

#### Check whats installed

Again we will be able to see all this in the node inventory:

`wash get inventory $(wash get hosts -ojson | jq -r '.hosts[0].id')`{{exec}}

If you did everything correctly, you will be able to call the actor via HTTP [localhost:8080]({{TRAFFIC_HOST1_8080}}) and see cute cats and dogs.
